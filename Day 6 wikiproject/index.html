                        Nepal,[a] officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal,[b] is a landlocked country in
                        South Asia. It is mainly
                        situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the
                        Tibet Autonomous Region of
                        China to the north, and India to the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from
                        Bangladesh by the
                        Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography,
                        including fertile
                        plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including
                        Mount Everest, the highest
                        point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic,
                        multi-lingual,
                        multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language.

                        The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent,
                        the era in ancient Nepal
                        when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the first
                        millennium BC, Gautama
                        Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal
                        were intertwined with
                        the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of
                        Indo-Aryans, and was the
                        seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the
                        ancient Silk Road was
                        dominated by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art
                        and architecture. By the
                        18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established
                        the Kingdom of Nepal
                        and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The
                        country was never
                        colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary
                        democracy was introduced
                        in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War
                        in the 1990s and early
                        2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu
                        monarchy.

                        The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a secular federal
                        parliamentary republic divided into
                        seven provinces. Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship treaties were
                        signed with India in
                        1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the South Asian Association for
                        Regional Cooperation
                        (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement
                        and the Bay of Bengal
                        Initiative. The Nepalese Armed Forces are the fifth-largest in South Asia; and are notable for
                        their Gurkha history,
                        particularly during the world wars, and has been a significant contributor to United Nations
                        peacekeeping operations.</p>

                        where they had earlier
                        evolved.[28][29][30] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000
                        years ago.[31] The
                        oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same
                        time.[32]

                        After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of
                        permanent structures, and
                        storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now
                        Balochistan.[33] These gradually
                        developed into the Indus Valley civilisation,[34][33] the first urban culture in South Asia.[35]
                        Prehistoric sites of
                        palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang
                        district.[36] The
                        earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the
                        Indus Valley civilisation.
                        It is possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in
                        the Indian subcontinent
                        (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the
                        Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans
                        from across the border.[37] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had reached Nepal either
                        directly across the Himalayas
                        from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or both.[38] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a
                        substratum of a race of
                        pre-Dravidians and Dravidians, who were in Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority
                        of the ancient
                        inhabitants of the valley of Kathmandu.[39]

                        By the late Vedic period, Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu texts, such as the late
                        Vedic Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa
                        and in the post-Vedic Atharvashirsha Upanishad.[40] The Gopal Bansa was the oldest dynasty to be
                        mentioned in various
                        texts as the earliest rulers of the central Himalayan kingdom known by the name 'Nepal'.[41] The
                        Gopalas were followed
                        by Kiratas who ruled for over 16 centuries by some accounts.[42] According to the Mahabharata,
                        the then Kirata king went
                        to take part in the Battle of Kurukshetra. In the south-eastern region, Janakpurdham was the
                        capital of the prosperous
                        kingdom of Videha or Mithila, that extended down to the Ganges, and home to King Janaka and his
                        daughter, Sita.

                        Around 600 BC, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of
                        Nepal. From one of these, the
                        Shakya polity, arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life, founded
                        Buddhism, and came to be
                        known as Gautama Buddha (traditionally dated 563–483 BC).[43] Nepal came to be established as a
                        land of spirituality and
                        refuge in the intervening centuries, played an important role in transmitting Buddhism to East
                        Asia via Tibet,[44] and
                        helped preserve Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts.

                        By 250 BC, the southern regions had come under the influence of the Maurya Empire. Emperor
                        Ashoka made a pilgrimage to
                        Lumbini and erected a pillar at Buddha's birthplace, the inscriptions on which mark the starting
                        point for properly
                        recorded history of Nepal.[45] Ashoka also visited the Kathmandu valley and built monuments
                        commemorating Gautama
                        Buddha's visit there. By the 4th century AD, much of Nepal was under the influence of the Gupta
                        Empire.[f][46]

                        In the Kathmandu valley, the Kiratas were pushed eastward by the Licchavis, and the Licchavi
                        dynasty came into power c.
                        400 AD. The Lichchhavis built monuments and left a series of inscriptions; Nepal's history of
                        the period is pieced
                        together almost entirely from them.[47][44] In 641, Songtsen Gampo of the Tibetan Empire sends
                        Narendradeva back to
                        Licchavi with an army and subjugates Nepal. Parts of Nepal and Licchavi was later under the
                        direct influences of the
                        Tibetan empire.[48] The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late 8th century and was
                        followed by a Thakuri rule.
                        Thakuri kings ruled over the country up to the middle of the 11th century AD; not much is known
                        of this period that is
                        often called the dark period.[49]</p>

                    <h3 id="medieval">Medieval Nepal</h3>
                    <p>In the 11th century, a powerful empire of Khas people emerged in western Nepal whose territory at
                        its highest peak
                        included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western Tibet and Uttarakhand of India. By
                        the 14th century, the
                        empire had splintered into loosely associated Baise rajyas, literally 22 states as they were
                        counted. The rich culture
                        and language of the Khas people spread throughout Nepal and as far as Indo-China in the
                        intervening centuries; their
                        language, later renamed the Nepali language, became the lingua franca of Nepal as well as much
                        of North-east India.[44]

                        In south-eastern Nepal, Simraungarh annexed Mithila around 1100 AD, and the unified Tirhut stood
                        as a powerful kingdom
                        for more than 200 years,[50] even ruling over Kathmandu for a time.[51] After another 300 years
                        of Muslim rule, Tirhut
                        came under the control of the Sens of Makawanpur.[50] In the eastern hills, a confederation of
                        Kirat principalities
                        ruled the area between Kathmandu and Bengal.

                        In the Kathmandu valley, the Mallas, who make several appearances in Nepalese history since
                        ancient times, had
                        established themselves in Kathmandu and Patan by the middle of the 14th century. The Mallas
                        ruled the valley first under
                        the suzerainty of Tirhut but established independent reign by late 14th century as Tirhut went
                        into decline. In the late
                        14th century, Jayasthiti Malla introduced widespread socio-economic reforms, principal of which
                        was the caste system. By
                        dividing the indigenous non-Aryan Buddhist population into castes modelled after the four Varna
                        system of Hinduism, he
                        provided an influential model for the Sanskritisation and Hinduisation of the indigenous
                        non-Hindu tribal populations in
                        all principalities throughout Nepal. By the middle of the 15th century, Kathmandu had become a
                        powerful empire which,
                        according to Kirkpatrick, extended from Digarchi or Sigatse in Tibet to Tirhut and Gaya in
                        India.[52] In the late 15th
                        century, Malla princes divided their kingdom in four – Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur in the
                        valley and Banepa to the
                        east. The competition for prestige among these brotherly kingdoms saw the flourishing of art and
                        architecture in central
                        Nepal, and the building of famous Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares; their division
                        and mistrust led to
                        their fall in the late 18th century, and ultimately, the unification of Nepal into a modern
                        state.[44][53]

                        Apart from one destructive sacking of Kathmandu valley in the mid 14th century,[54] Nepal
                        remains largely untouched by
                        the Muslim invasion of India that began in the 11th century. The Mughal period saw an influx of
                        high-caste Hindus from
                        India into Nepal. They soon intermingled with the Khas people and by the 16th century, there
                        were about 50 Rajput-ruled
                        principalities in Nepal, including the 22 (Baisi) states and, to their east in west-central
                        Nepal, 24 Chaubisi states.
                        There emerged a view that Nepal remained the true bastion of unadulterated Hinduism at a time
                        when Indian culture had
                        been influenced by centuries of Mughal, followed by British rule. Gorkha, one of the Baisi
                        states, emerged as an
                        influential and ambitious kingdom with a reputation for justice, after it codified the first
                        Hinduism-based laws in the
                        Nepalese hills.[44]</p>
